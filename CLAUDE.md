# loyalty-app — Claude Code briefing

Multi-tenant CRM and loyalty program. Live pilot in a single T4 tea franchise; the architecture supports going SaaS without a rewrite.

Stack one-liner: **Bun + Turborepo + Next 16 (App Router) + tRPC v11 + Better Auth + Drizzle + Neon Postgres + Trigger.dev v3 + Better Stack + Vercel auto-deploy + @serwist/next PWA + shadcn (Base UI) + Storybook 9 + next-intl (es/en).**

## Hard rules

These have come up enough that they're load-bearing — break them and something breaks:

- **Grill the plan before building a feature.** For any net-new feature (not a trivial fix/refactor/docs change), run the `grill-me` skill to stress-test the plan/design — edge cases, trade-offs, scope — *before* writing code. Pairs with plan mode.
- **PR-only on `main`.** Branch protection blocks direct pushes. Every change opens `gh pr create`, even tiny ones. The `validate` CI check is required.
- **CI validates, Vercel deploys.** GitHub Actions runs lint + knip + typecheck + test. Vercel's Git integration handles all deploys for `loyalty-app-web`, `loyalty-app-admin`, and `loyalty-app-storybook`.
- **English in repo, Spanish only in Linear and in `messages/es.json`.** Code, comments, errors, commits, PR descriptions, READMEs, skills → English. Visible Linear surfaces (issues, projects, milestones, labels) → Spanish. User-facing copy is split per locale in `apps/<app>/messages/{es,en}.json`.
- **Default to writing no comments.** Add one only when the *why* is non-obvious.
- **Never hand-edit DB migrations.** Change the Drizzle schema, then `bun run db:generate`.
- **shadcn copy-paste model.** Components in `packages/ui/src/components/ui/<name>.tsx` are *yours* — modify them directly. Don't wrap them in another abstraction layer.

## Default workflow — superpowers + grill-me

For non-trivial work we follow the **superpowers** skill flow (`obra/superpowers`) by default, complemented by **`grill-me`**:

1. **`brainstorming`** — before any feature/creative work, explore intent + requirements (don't jump to code).
2. **`grill-me`** — stress-test the resulting plan/design (our complement; pairs with plan mode).
3. **`writing-plans`** → **`executing-plans`** / **`subagent-driven-development`** — write the plan, then execute against checkpoints.
4. **`test-driven-development`** + **`systematic-debugging`** — red-green-refactor; debug methodically before patching.
5. **`verification-before-completion`** — run the checks and confirm the output **before** claiming anything is done.
6. **`requesting-code-review`** → **`finishing-a-development-branch`** — review, then integrate via the PR-only flow above.

`using-superpowers` is the dispatcher (invoke the right skill before responding). Skills are managed by the `skills` CLI and pinned in **`skills-lock.json`** — a teammate restores them with `npx skills experimental_install`; `.agents/skills/` + the `.claude/skills/` symlinks are gitignored.

The superpowers `test-driven-development`/`systematic-debugging`/`writing-skills` replace the older mattpocock `tdd`/`diagnose`/`write-a-skill` (removed to avoid duplicate triggers). Remaining mattpocock skills (`grill-me`, `handoff`, `prototype`, `to-prd`, `to-issues`, `triage`, `improve-codebase-architecture`) are unique and stay.

## i18n rules

Most error-prone area for agents. Read the `next-intl` skill before touching anything under `apps/*/app/[locale]/`. TL;DR:

- **Never import from `next/link` or `next/navigation`** inside `apps/*/app/[locale]/**` or `apps/*/components/**`. Use `@/i18n/navigation` instead. (`notFound` from `next/navigation` is fine — it's locale-agnostic.)
- **Every page and layout that calls `getTranslations` must call `setRequestLocale(locale)` first** — otherwise static rendering breaks silently.
- **`generateMetadata` always passes `locale` explicitly** to `getTranslations`.
- **Add new locales by editing `apps/<app>/i18n/routing.ts` + creating `messages/<code>.json`** in BOTH apps — no other code changes needed.
- **Folder names under `app/[locale]/` are in English** (`profile`, `card`, `customers`, `rewards`) — they're code. The visible URL is translated per locale via `pathnames`. `<Link href="...">` always takes the canonical English route key.
- **The request-interception file is `proxy.ts`** (Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts`). Don't create `middleware.ts` — it's deprecated and will be removed.
- **`/offline`, `/api/*`, `/sw.js`, `/manifest.webmanifest`** are locale-agnostic and excluded from the proxy matcher.

## Things newcomers (or future you) might assume wrongly

- **Components are NOT npm deps.** `@loyalty/ui` ships shadcn components copied into the repo. To "upgrade" Button, edit `packages/ui/src/components/ui/button.tsx`. Don't `bunx shadcn add button --reinstall` and expect the old customizations to survive — review the diff manually.
- **`@/cn` and `@/components/ui/*` aliases only work inside `packages/ui`.** When CLI-installed components arrive, their `@/` imports get rewritten to relative paths so consumer apps (which have their own `@/` aliasing) resolve correctly. See the `ui` skill for the sed pattern.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` are optional.** `apps/{web,admin}/src/lib/app-url.ts` derives the URL from `VERCEL_URL` automatically. Set them explicitly only for custom domains or cross-app preview testing.
- **`apps/{web,admin}` use a `src/` layout.** Everything except `app/` (routes) lives under `src/{lib,components,i18n,features,env.ts}`. The `@/*` alias resolves to `./src/*`. See `.claude/skills/architecture-guard/SKILL.md`.
- **Sensitive env vars in Vercel.** Marked Sensitive = not returned by `vercel pull`, not readable to builds running outside Vercel. Keep build-time vars (DATABASE_URL etc.) as Plain Text.
- **The web app's service worker is disabled in dev** so HMR works. Build + start (or check on a preview deploy) to exercise PWA behavior.
- **Toast is `sonner`, not `Toast`.** Base UI doesn't ship a Toast primitive; we use `sonner` instead. There's a `<Toaster />` you mount once and `toast(...)` to call from anywhere.
- **Form-control height differs by app.** `@loyalty/ui` controls (`Input`, `InputPhone`, `Textarea`, `Select`/`NativeSelect`) default to **h-14 (56px)** for the touch-first customer PWA. In **apps/admin**, single-line controls must be **h-10 (40px)** — pass `className="h-10"` (Input/Textarea/SelectTrigger override h-14 via tailwind-merge) or `size="sm"` (InputPhone). Admin forms read denser; the customer app keeps 56px.
- **Next 16 renders dynamic by default.** Pages under `app/[locale]/` are server-rendered on demand unless you opt into `cacheComponents: true` + `"use cache"` directives. This is fine for an auth-aware app — most pages need to be dynamic anyway.
